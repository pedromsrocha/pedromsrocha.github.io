Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Pedro. 
 
The SVG image in the background of my homepage is a reproduction of Escher's 
[Square Limit](https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.135604.html), generated by a [program](/code/) written in Elm.
I've chosen it as the frontispiece of my website because it shows 
how beautiful things can be produced by abstracting and composing the _right_ patterns. Ultimately, this is the kind of beauty that draws me to computer science, engineering and mathematics. 

I currently hold a post-doctoral research fellowship in [NOVA LINCS](https://nova-lincs.di.fct.unl.pt/), working in
the development and implementation of programming language [CLASS](http://ctp.di.fct.unl.pt/CLASS/): a session-typed language for safe programming with shared state. 
CLASS is the outcome of my PhD in Computer Science, which was 
awarded by the [School of Science and Technology of NOVA University of Lisbon](https://www.fct.unl.pt/en)
in 2022. Check my [research page](/research/) for more details. 

During 2015-2016 I worked as R&D engineer in [Synopsys Inc.](https://www.synopsys.com/), where I did verification
of HDMI protocol-compliant devices using static timing analysis and functional coverage.

I have a M.Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering, awarded in 2014, by the
Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto. In my [master thesis](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/73404), I applied matroid theory
 to design an algorithm that finds the minimum number of 
dedicated outputs of a linear system that guarantee its observability. 

Some trivia: I do yoga, I'm into board games and trekking with my furry four-legged companion named [Bess](/bess/).
