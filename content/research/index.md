I'm currently working in
the development and implementation of programming language CLASS. [Here](http://ctp.di.fct.unl.pt/CLASS/) you can find a stable open-source version of the implementation together with several examples. 

A bit about CLASS: some programming languages have strong foundations in Logic,
by exploring something known as the [Curry-Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence). My PhD advisor 
and collaborators had established an [instantiation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-15375-4_16) of this correspondence, by connecting
[Linear Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_logic) and [Session Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_type). During my PhD we extended this connection in order 
to accommodate shared mutable state, which is an essential building block
of modern software development. The resulting language CLASS lies at sweet spot 
between expressiveness and safety: we can code 
realistic concurrent programs involving memory-efficient linked data structures and
and sophisticated thread synchronisation. The logical foundations guarantee that well-typed 
CLASS programs do not go wrong: they never deadlock, do not leak memory and they always terminate. 

Below you can find my publications and some of my talks.
